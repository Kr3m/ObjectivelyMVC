Objectively - MVC Framework
---

SDL_mvc is a user interface and interaction framework for [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org) inspired by 
Apple's [Cocoa model-view-controller API](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/general/conceptual/devpedia-cocoacore/MVC.html). 
It is geared towards building high-quality, modern looking user interfaces within [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) 
video games that are already using SDL2.
