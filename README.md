Objectively - MVC

Object Oriented MVC Framework for OpenGL and SDL2
---

ObjectivelyMVC is a user interface and interaction framework for [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org) inspired by 
Apple's [Cocoa model-view-controller API](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/general/conceptual/devpedia-cocoacore/MVC.html). 
It is geared towards building high-quality, modern looking user interfaces within [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) 
video games that are already using SDL2. It is written in GNU C, and requires `gcc` or `clang`.
